 *
 * When you construct a zview, you are promising that the underlying string is
 * zero-terminated.  It otherwise behaves exactly like a std::string_view.
 * The terminating zero is not "in" the string, so it does not count as part of
 * the view's length.
 *
 * The added guarantee lets the view be used as a C-style string, which often
 * matters since libpqxx builds on top of a C library.  For this reason, zview
 * also adds a @c c_str method.
